# ROAD-ACCIDENT-ANALYSIS



ðŸš¦ Road Accident Analysis Dashboard ðŸš¦


Thrilled to share one of my recent projects where I built a Power BI dashboard to analyze road accident data and uncover valuable insights.


This dashboard provides a deep dive into:

 âœ… Total casualties, accidents, and severity trends
 âœ… Accident distribution by vehicle type, road type, and light conditions
 âœ… Urban vs. rural accident breakdown
 âœ… Location-based analysis across the UK

 
What excites me most about this project is not just the data visualization, but the impact it can create. By analyzing patterns such as peak accident months, common vehicle types, and high-risk areas, such insights can be used to improve road safety policies and potentially save lives.


This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
 ðŸ”¹ Power BI (visualization & DAX)
 ðŸ”¹ Data storytelling
 ðŸ”¹ Turning raw data into actionable insights

 
I believe data, when presented effectively, can make a real difference. ðŸš—ðŸ’¡
